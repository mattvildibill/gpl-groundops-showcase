# Threat Model (Local Dev Scope)

This showcase runs locally with no external dependencies. The intent is to demonstrate security boundaries and traceability, not a production-ready threat posture.

## Key Assets
- Mission plan metadata (asset, timing, priority)
- Tasking tickets derived from plans
- Audit trail and correlation IDs

## Primary Threats + Mitigations
- **Token leakage**
  - Risk: Local JWT secret reused across services.
  - Mitigation: Dev-only secret, short expiry, explicit warning in README.

- **Unauthorized access**
  - Risk: UI or scripts call privileged endpoints without roles.
  - Mitigation: Role-based checks on each service (`PLANNER`, `OPS`, `AUDITOR`, `EXEC`).

- **Event tampering**
  - Risk: Forged JMS messages.
  - Mitigation: Broker requires credentials; consumers validate event payloads.

- **Audit integrity**
  - Risk: Audit log mutation or deletion.
  - Mitigation: Append-only in-memory list, no deletion endpoints.

- **Correlation ID spoofing**
  - Risk: Client-supplied correlation IDs could be misleading.
  - Mitigation: IDs are generated by server when missing; propagation is logged and visible.

## Out of Scope (Intentional)
- External IdP integration
- Data-at-rest encryption
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Production-grade secrets management
